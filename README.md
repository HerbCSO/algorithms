# Algorithms

Test implementations for the Introduction to Algorithms book

## Notes

* You will likely find errors and mistakes as I am pushing commits to this repo as I'm learning. There is no commitment that everything will be perfect here at all times.
* I will however create test branches as I'm playing with implementations and I will try to keep master stable.
* I'm not going to keep the commit history 100% clean since this repo is helping me learn the algorithms and making mistakes is part of the learning process, so I do want to preserve that in this case.
